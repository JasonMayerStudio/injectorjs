FA-Injector Example 001

This is a very simple example that uses the fa-injector to load a simple JS
library.  In the example the library is loaded by calling the loadFeature in
the injector directly.

To run this example all you need is a basic server... might I suggest https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html?
