FA-Injector Example 004

This is a very simple example that uses the fa-injector to load a webpack
bundle.  The bundle combines multiple JS files.  In the example the bundle is loaded by calling the loadFeature with a data tag.

To run this example you first need to run bower install to get jquery and fa-injector.  
Then all you need is a basic server...
might I suggest https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html?
